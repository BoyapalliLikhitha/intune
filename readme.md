7. **Q&A**
   - Finally, we'll open the floor for any questions you may have about our solution, its implementation, or its potential impact.

Let's begin by addressing the problem statement that inspired our innovation."

In todayâ€™s increasingly complex IT landscape, organizations often deploy a mix of devices across various operating systems to meet diverse operational needs. Microsoft Intune and Jamf Pro are widely used for managing Windows and Apple devices, respectively. However, managing these platforms independently can be cumbersome and inefficient for IT administrators.

To address these challenges, we propose a unified interface that integrates both Intune and Jamf operations. This integration significantly enhances device management efficiency, streamlines workflows, and ensures consistent policy enforcement across all devices.

To build this solution, we utilized the Intune and Jamf APIs along with HTML, CSS, and Node.js for the UI. We are hosting this interface as an Azure Static Web App, ensuring scalability and robust performance
